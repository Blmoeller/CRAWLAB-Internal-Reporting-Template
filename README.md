## CRAWLAB Internal Reporting Markdown Template

This repository contains the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) template for individual researcher reports internal to the lab.


### Reporting Instructions   

Please create a top-level folder in your personal GitHub folder named "Internal Reporting". Then, for each report, create a sub-folder with that one named `20xx_mm_dd_Lastname`. Name the `.md` file for the report within that folder similarly, `20xx_mm_dd_Lastname.md`.

I will watch for the sync notification to see that you're ready for me to review. Please make the commit message for the review-ready version: "Ready for Review - Report 20xx_mm_dd". That way I don't start looking at a version that's just a draft.

I will sync my comments with a commit message of "Comments for Lastname - Report 20xx_mm_dd".
